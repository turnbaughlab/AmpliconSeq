# Protocol 3: Cherry Picking and Indexing PCR

## Theory

While the primary PCR has created the amplicons for sequencing, there is no identifying information on the DNA to tell the sample of origin. This is the purpose of the indexing PCR. In the emp protocol, a single index/barcode is incorporated onto the reverse (or forward depending on version) primer. Here there are two indices/barcodes on both sides of the amplicon. In this way, fewer barcodes can be used as samples are recognized as the combination of left and right barcodes. For example, in our current set up 24 forward, and 24 reverse give 576 combinations. The same amount of sequence capacity would require 576 distinct (and long, and expensive) reverse primers. There are currently 6 replicate sets of primer aliquots in the -20˚C. Please note your usage and date on the bag.

The first step of this protocol is to pick the appropriate dilution from the primary PCR. If using low biomass samples, this step should be skipped as dilutions were not performed. This can be performed automatically using a script included in resources called DilutionPick.R. It can be run as below to generate a table of the wells to be picked. Note to run you will require an installation of R and the packages: tidyverse, readxl, and optparse.

```
Rscript ~/GitHub/AmpliconSeq/resources/DilutionPick.R --csv "primarypcr/CALORICRESTRICT-admin_2020-11-30 19-05-20_CT018087 -  Quantification Amplification Results_SYBR.csv" --tracking 16S_TrackingSheet.xlsx --plateid 4
```

The resulting outputs include WellsForIndexing_PlateX.csv and PrimaryCurves_PlateX.pdf. The amplification curves show which dilution was selected for indexing based on trying to be closest to 0.7x the maximum (i.e. plateaued) signal as seen in Figure 1. The goal is to prevent over amplification. Note also from these plots what has happened with your negative controls, for example as seen in Figure 2.

The most important output is the WellsForIndexing.csv file which needs to be copy and pasted inside of 3_CherryPickandIndex_template.py.

# Protocol
- [ ] Obtain a plate of indexes from the freezer and thaw on ice. **Breifly centrifuge before opening!!!!!**
- [ ] Download a copy of 3_CheryPickAndIndex.py and copy and paste your loadings from the WellsForIndexing.csv file into it.
- [ ] Set up the OT2 as in Figure 1. *Note: you can manually load the indexing mastermix and water to the dilution plate if a reservoir is not available. Adjust loadwater = False and loadmastermix = False in the python script*
- [ ] Load python script on OT2
- [ ] Calibrate all deck positions
- [ ] Run script (Estimated run time = ~45 minutes).
- [ ] After completion, freeze plates until quantification and pooling.
